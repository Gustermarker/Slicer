# Slicer
A 3D printer slicer software built from scratch. Currently a work in progress. 

What is a slicer? A slicer takes in a 3D model (STL file), "slices" it into a bunch of horizontal layers, and generates a toolpath (in GCODE) from these newly created 2D layers. The toolpath is the path that the 3d printer takes to lay down the plastic.  

To do list:
1) Parse STL file into some usable data
2)
